# ML Income Classifier Using UCI Adult Data Set #

### Project Overview
In my Econometrics (ECON 418-518) class, we were asked to explore and implement various machine learning algorithms to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 using the UCI Adult Dataset. This project involves data cleaning/transforming, exploratory data analysis, as well as machine learning models including Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest.
