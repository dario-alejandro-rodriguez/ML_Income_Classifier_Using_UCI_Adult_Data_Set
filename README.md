# ML Income Classifier Using UCI Adult Data Set #

### Project Overview
In my Econometrics (ECON 418-518) class, we were asked to explore and implement various machine learning algorithms to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 using the UCI Adult Dataset. This project involved data cleaning/transforming, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models including Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest. This project bridges econometric theory and practical machine learning applications, by offering insights into how statistical models can help predict economic outcomes. By completing this project, I deepened and enhanced my understanding of ML regularization techniques and their real-world applications.
